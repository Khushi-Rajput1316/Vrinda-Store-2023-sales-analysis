In this project for Vrinda store, the primary goal was to create an annual sales report for 2022 to provide insights into customer behavior and drive sales growth in 2023. The project began with data cleaning, addressing inconsistencies such as standardizing gender categories and converting text-based quantities into numeric values. This was crucial for ensuring accurate analysis. 

Data processing involved categorizing ages into groups—adults, seniors, and teenagers—and extracting month names from date fields to facilitate monthly sales analysis. These steps laid the groundwork for detailed data analysis. Using pivot tables and charts, we created a comprehensive visualization comparing sales and orders, which revealed several key insights. 

The analysis showed that March had the highest sales and order volumes, while women made more purchases than men throughout the year. Most orders were successfully delivered, and the top contributing states to sales were identified. Notably, adult women (ages 30-49) emerged as the most significant customer segment, with a strong presence in states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Additionally, the data indicated that the majority of sales came through online channels, with Amazon being the most prominent.

These insights led to strategic recommendations for Vrinda store. To capitalize on the identified trends, the store should focus on targeting women aged 30-49 in the top contributing states. Marketing efforts should include tailored ads, offers, and coupons on popular online platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra. This targeted approach is expected to enhance customer engagement and drive higher sales in 2023.

Overall, the project provided a clear understanding of customer demographics, purchasing behaviors, and key sales channels, enabling Vrinda store to make informed decisions for future growth.
